== External Services ==

The WPaigen AI Generator plugin utilizes external services to provide its core functionality and secure payment processing. Here are the details regarding these services:

### 1. WPaigen API (Plugin Backend Service) <-- Changed to simply "WPaigen API"

This plugin connects to our custom backend API, the **WPaigen API**, for user license management and AI content generation functionality.

* **What the service is and what it is used for:**
    * The **WPaigen API** is a backend service provided by the plugin developer (Taruna Wahyudi) to process license-related requests, manage feature usage, and generate AI content (articles) based on user input.
    * **API URL:** `https://wp-ai-generator-api-production.up.railway.app`

* **What data is sent and when:**
    * **Free License Registration:** When a user registers for a free license, your **email** and **site domain** are sent to the WPaigen API to generate and record the license key.
    * **License Activation:** When you activate a license (both free and Pro), your **license key** and **site domain** are sent to validate and activate the license on your site.
    * **License Validation:** Periodically, or when certain features are accessed, your **license key** (as an Authorization header) and **site domain** are sent to validate the license status. This ensures the plugin operates according to your license plan and adheres to usage limits.
    * **Article Generation:** When you request to generate an article, the **keyword, language, length (word count), and tone** you selected are sent to the WPaigen API. This data is used by the AI model on the backend to generate the requested content.
    * **Plugin Updates:** The plugin makes calls to the API to check for available updates, sending the **plugin slug** and current **plugin version**.
    * **Plugin Information:** The plugin may retrieve general information about itself from the API.
    * **Transaction Creation:** When you initiate a purchase for the Pro version, your **email** and **site domain** are sent to create a transaction record.
    * **Contact Us:** If you use the contact form within the plugin, your **name, email, and message** will be sent to the API for communication purposes.
    * **Free Version Download:** When a user downloads the free version, their **email** is sent for recording and distribution purposes.

* **Privacy Policy and Terms of Service:**
    * For information regarding data handling and service terms related to WPaigen API, please refer to our dedicated pages:
        * **WPaigen API Terms of Service:** [https://wpaigen.stacklab.id/terms](https://wpaigen.stacklab.id/terms)
        * **WPaigen API Privacy Policy:** [https://wpaigen.stacklab.id/privacy](https://wpaigen.stacklab.id/privacy)

### 2. Midtrans Snap.js (Payment Service)

For secure payment processing when you upgrade to WPaigen Pro, the plugin integrates a third-party payment service. <-- Changed to simply "WPaigen Pro"

* **What the service is and what it is used for:**
    * **Midtrans Snap.js** is a JavaScript library from Midtrans, a payment gateway provider. It is used to initialize and display a secure payment interface (payment widget) directly on your site, allowing you to make payments for Pro upgrades without leaving your **WP dashboard**.
    * **Service URL:** `https://api.midtrans.com/snap/snap.js`

* **What data is sent and when:**
    * When you choose to upgrade to the Pro version and click the payment button, Midtrans Snap.js is loaded.
    * Transaction information such as the **payment amount, item details (e.g., WPaigen Pro subscription), and basic customer information (name, email, site domain â€“ which you previously provided within the plugin)** are sent to Midtrans servers via Snap.js to process the payment. This includes data necessary for transaction identification and processing through various methods offered by Midtrans (e.g., bank transfer, credit card, e-wallets, etc.).
    * Once the payment is complete, Midtrans will send a **callback** (payment status notification) to the WPaigen API (`/api/transactions/midtrans/callback`) to confirm the transaction and automatically activate your license. The data sent in this callback includes `order_id`, `transaction_status`, `payment_type`, `settlement_time`, and other details relevant to the payment status.

* **Privacy Policy and Terms of Service:**
    * **Midtrans** is a leading third-party payment service provider in Indonesia. You can review their privacy policy and terms of service on their official website:
        * **Midtrans Terms of Service:** [https://midtrans.com/promoenginetnc](https://midtrans.com/promoenginetnc)
